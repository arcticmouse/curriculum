### Projected Time

### Motivation
I want to link to other websites and show images.

### Objective
**Students will be able to** use `<a>` and `<img>` successfully, and explain the difference between a tag, tag name, tag attribute, and the content contained by the tag.

### Specific Things To Teach
- Attributes
  - go inside the open tag angle brackets, after the tag name
  - have an equal sign
  - the name of the attribute goes on the left of the equal sign
  - the value of the attribute goes on the right of the equal sign, in double quotes

- A tags 
  - are for links
  - `href` is an attribute
  - ANY url can be the value of `href`
  
- IMG tags
  - are for images
  - 'src' is an attribute
  - 'alt' is an attribute  

- How to find the url of an image
  - any website
    - "copy link address"
    - open image in new tab
  - google images
